	 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps in analyzing how scalable a solution is when dealing with larger data sets.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. It is usually expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), and helps in understanding how much additional storage an algorithm requires during its execution.
